# Code-Breaker-Solver
This is a python script I made a time ago that helps to solve a type of numeric puzzle, the old games I know with this type of puzzle calls it "Code Breaker", consist in trying to guess a number (without repeating digits), each try you write a number and the game tells you how many numbers are correct and how many of them are in the correct position, from this the program can filter until it have 1 possible number, or none, in that case try again.

Is not perfect and I don't think it works with numbers with repeated digits.
